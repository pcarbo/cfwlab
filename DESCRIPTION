Description: This R package contains data from "Genome-wide
  association study of behavioral, physiological and gene expression
  traits in outbred CFW mice" (C. Parker et al, 2016,
  <DOI:10.1038/ng.3609>). These data were collected as part of a large
  study to assess the viability of using Carworth Farms White (CFW)
  mice for mapping genes and genetic loci underlying complex traits
  relevant to the study of human disease and psychology.
